# Welcome to my Advent of Code Repo!

The Advent of Code is an amazing set of Christmas themed coding challenges that come out every year.  Every day in December you are presented with a well crafted story that explains how you will move through your challenge.  Once part 1 is complete, you will be given a similar but altered challenge to complete.  The goal is to gain two stars per day, and finish the story!  

Per the requirements of the challenges, I have not included any of the inputs.  If you would like to see the type of inputs provided, you can look at the website below.
